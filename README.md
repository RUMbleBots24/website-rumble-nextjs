# Welcome to the RUMblebots Website Repository!

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/uprmrumblebots/website/_apis/build/status%2FDeploy%20to%20Azure?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/uprmrumblebots/website/_build/latest?definitionId=4&branchName=main)

## Stack
We'll be using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) in the implementation of this website. This instance of Next.js uses Typescript and [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) easier styling.

We have not decided what database we are going to use. We'll update you here when that changes.

**We highly recommend looking at the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) and [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) documentation if you don't have any past experience with the frameworks. They are very particular in the way they work.**

## Workflow Guidelines
- Always create a new branch for any feature not matter the size.
- To merge the changes create a pull request that will be verified by the team leader and other members.
- Use descriptive titles for the commits and PRs. Write brief descriptions on the PRs of the changes made.
- **Never commit changes directly to main.**
